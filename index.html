                <h4>Intern Web Designer</h4>
                <p>Immediately out of Business School, I was able to use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to make webpage edits and light debugging. The JS, HTML, and CSS were all learned after taking part in a coding bootcamp as well as previous self-paced/self-taught materials</p>

                <h4>Dental Assistant</h4>
                <p>That's interesting. Given the option to continue down the path of web development or assit an underserved population, I chose the latter. Here I learned how to handle working in a fast-paced enviornment, the importance of attention to detail, working as part of a team, and adapting to always changing scenarios.</p>

                <h4>Administrative Assistant / Interim Webmaster</h4>
                <p>I was provided the opportunity to work as assistant to the Dean, Administrative Assistant, and what I call "interim Webmaster". From working under strict deadlines, building and maintaining pages based on guidelines, time and priority management, and others this has definitely not been a boring one.</p>

                <p>Can't play to save my life. I do like listening to it though. I can go from today's hits to classical and it makes no difference so long as the music sounds good.</p>

                <p>Can't play to save my life. NFL and tennis are my top two favorite sports, but I'm trying to get into hockey and other, alternative sports. Skateboarding, Snowboarding, Swimming, Track and Field, Bowling, etc.</p>

                <p>This one I can do! Been playing since the original NES, but I've been playing exponentially less than I did back in the day. Still have my SEGA Genesis and N64 somewhere and my Wii is still hooked up. Otherwise, it's basically small stuff on the PC from time to time.</p>
