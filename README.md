# hello-there
Page acting as a resume website for anyone willing to take a look

Update: 11-14-2022
Hello There is a take on the famous "Hello World". The difference here is that, rather than a single statement,
we have a full on webpage! This page is to be used to demonstrate knowledge in the fundementals of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. The page is designed to be sememantically sound in HTML, equipped with various media queries for responsiveness. Built and designed with flexbox and a touch of Javascript to provide interactivity when clicking on
the hamburger menu at the top right of the screen. Also, through use of healthy mixing of Javascript and CSS, said hamburger menu only appears on tablet and phone sizes while larger displays show menus with the hamburger menu hidden.

Hello there currently does not have a projects section to display on its page, but this is set to change in the future! Until then, "Hello There" is effectively an elevator pitch resume page.
